# Data-analysis-use-case-in-R

As part of your work as data analysts in the marketing department of Binky Cosmetics Ltd., the company's VP, who is not familiar with data analysis at all, asked you to provide explanations regarding the decrease in the volume of sales of the company's products. To accomplish this task, the company vice president provides you with a data collection that includes all the transactions the company has made in the past year and the profit (or loss) from each transaction. In addition, the data collection includes a number of variables related to technical operations that are part of the cosmetics manufacturing process. Some of the variables that exist in the data set (Dataset) you received:
"Serial_no" - The serial number of each sales transaction.
"Age" - the age of the customer.
"Prod_dest" - the destination to which the product in the transaction was sent (the country in which the customer resides).
"Usage" - a variable that indicates whether the product contains only natural materials or whether it contains artificial materials.
"salesman_name" - The name of the salesperson who was in contact with the customer in the same transaction.
"Product" - the product sold to the customer in the transaction.
"Profit" - the profit or loss generated as a result of the transaction.
Unfortunately, you do not know the meaning of the other variables (most of them carry an engineering nature related to the process of manufacturing the cosmetics themselves).


Tasks:
1. Check whether there is a relationship between the product sold to the customer and his age, distinguishing between products that contain only natural materials and products that also contain artificial materials. Attach to your answer a diagram that visually describes the relationship described above.

2. The company's CFO believes that a model can be built that will explain the relationship between profit or loss generated in transactions with US customers in a better way than a model that will explain the same relationship for transactions with Swedish customers. Is the CFO's claim correct? Describe in your answer the characteristics of each of the models (including the best explanatory variables and the significance of the model).

3. The company's vice president asks you to build a model that predicts as accurately as possible (40 points).
 Select the appropriate task for data mining (classification or regression).
 Avoid overfitting, even at the expense of model performance during the training phase.
 You must try 2 algorithms as part of choosing the best model
 
A. Briefly explain what actions you performed at each of the steps in the CRISP DM (Cross-industry standard process for data mining).

B. What is the best model you have built? Why is this model better than the other models?

c. Present the confusion matrix for the model you have chosen.

D. Explain the actual meaning of the Recall, Precision and AUC values obtained in the best model.
